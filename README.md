# MLE-Zoomcamp-M12-Car-Damage-Classification-Capstone-Project

## Introduction

In the insurance industry, processing claims for vehicle damage is a common and essential task. This project focuses on developing a robust and high-performance model for classifying images of damaged cars into different types of damages using computer vision techniques.

## Problem Statement

Insurance companies face challenges in identifying fraudulent claims, especially those exaggerating the extent of damage. The goal of this project is to mitigate financial losses by accurately classifying images and assessing the legitimacy of claims.

## Dataset

We have a dataset of car images labeled with different types of damages:
1. Crack
2. Scratch
3. Tire Flat
4. Dent
5. Glass Shatter
6. Lamp Broken

## Project Structure

The project is organized into CRISP-DM phases for effective development and documentation.
